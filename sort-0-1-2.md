###why did you use that data structure?
Linear Search is used to traverse through the whole list


### Explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution:
Time efficiency is O(n) since it needs to traverse through the entire list
#### Time efficiency

Worst case : O(n)
best case: O(1) 
average case: O(n) 

#### Space complexity: 0(1)
