###why did you use that data structure?
Trie Data structure is used. A trie is a tree-like data structure 
that stores a dynamic set of strings. Tries are commonly used
to facilitate operations like predictive text or autocomplete
features on mobile phones or web search.

### Explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution:
#### Time efficiency

Time complexity of searching, inserting and deleting from Trie
depends on number of sub domain/path (a) that is being searched/inserted/deleted
and number of total sub domain/path (n) present in Trie : 0(an)

#### Space complexity:
 0(an)
