###why did you use that data structure?
Binary Search Tree Data structure is used to achieve logn time complexity.
and to avoid searching through the whole set of integers.

### Explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution:
#### Time efficiency

Worst case : O(log(n))
best case: O(1) 
average case: O(log(n))

#### Space complexity: o(1)
